					<h2 class="title_1">Relationship coaching</h2>
					<div class="text-holder">
						<p>Good relationships are made up with time and personal maturity. It is not just luck or fate, but it is an understanding of female nature, a particular woman’s personality, and focusing on the idea of making a lady life better in new relationships. Natalie is a professional psychologist. With 23 years of matchmaking experience we can provide thorough support and help in understanding how a particular lady matches our male customer. We have many ideas on how to help couples communicate and keep the connection in the long term relationships. We provide recipes on how to move to the next level of international love relations and how to do it safely and correctly. Men and women are emotionally biased when it comes to discussing important things: their feelings often block the ability to face objective reality.

							Consulting with a professional love coach helps both parties see a bigger picture for the couple future. Thus our customers save their time, resources and avoid frustrations. A professional consultation with an expert opinion helps our male customers focus on the prospective lady and move forward their love story. </p>

					<h2 class="title_1">Accommodation in Ukraine</h2>
					<div class="text-holder">
						<p>Ukraine is famous for its outstanding hospitality. Our goal is making our male customers stay here pleasant and comfortable. Ukraine may become a second home for some of them so we care to begin this story in the best way. There are many good hotels and apartments in Kyiv. In all this diversity we help our male customers find the most suitable accommodation for their available budget,  and feel like home. Our recommendation for a matchmaking trip is to choose a private apartment in the city center. We have modern and cozy fully equipped options within walking distance of our marriage agency in Kiev.

							By living in the center our male customers avoid the traffic and have more time to enjoy their dates in our fabulous city. If a customer prefers a hotel, no problem. There are famous chains like Hyatt, Hilton, Intercontinental, Radisson and cute boutique hotels, where we can always negotiate a better price.</p>
